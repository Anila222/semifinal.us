AC Milan vs Inter Milan LIVE Streaming info: When, where to watch Champions League?
This Champions League clash will be a rematch of last year‚Äôs semifinal, when Real Madrid got the better of a Manchester City team that didn‚Äôt have Erling Haaland.

First came a return to the top of Italian football, now comes a chance to reach the Champions League final.

The Milan teams are back.

But only one will get the opportunity to compete for European football‚Äôs top prize as AC Milan faces city rival Inter Milan in the semifinals of the Champions League.

The victor will face either Real Madrid or Manchester City in the final.

Three-time European champion Inter was the last Italian club to lift the trophy, when it won an unprecedented treble of the league, Italian Cup and Champions League under Jos√© Mourinho in 2010.

Milan won the last of its seven titles in 2007.

This is the fifth time the Milan sides have faced each other in European competition, but it is the first at this stage since 2003.

In the last round, AC Milan beat Serie A champions Napoli and Inter saw off Portuguese big guns Benfica.

With a place in the Champions League final against either Real Madrid or Manchester City up for grabs, this promises to be a special occasion that will see the city of Milan divided.
